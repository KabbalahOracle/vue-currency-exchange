# vue-currency-exchange

> Currency exchange example application using Vue.js

## Description

This application is part of a proof of concept that tries to compare Angular and Vue.js.

The *PoC* consists in develop the same simple web application using both technologies.

You can see the application developed using Angular in [this repository](https://github.com/pablolazaro/ng-currency-exchange).

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
